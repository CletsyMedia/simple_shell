## Introduction

Welcome to our Simple Shell project, where code and dreams converge! Within this realm of hallowed scriptorium, we unveil a command-line interpreter, a humble oracle, granting you access to the soul of your computer's operating symphony.

Our Simple Shell, like a muse from Unix's ethereal tapestry, gracefully mirrors the grandeur of its Bash brethren, yet dances with the grace of simplicity, offering a serene haven for seekers of the elemental.

This collaborative odyssey unfolds, forging a path towards a user-friendly, Unix-like sanctuary, where the essence of command-line artistry thrives. We embark on a quest to illuminate the secrets of shell symphonies, to be the guiding light for fledgling minds.

So, dear kindred spirits, heed the call and join us in this eloquent creation, where function meets instruction, and together, we craft a sonnet of command-line mastery. In our Simple Shell, let code and camaraderie unite us in the tapestry of Unix dreams.

## Features

- An interactive command-line interface, where keystrokes become notes in the shell's timeless melody.

- Support for invoking external commands, where binaries and scripts sing in harmony with built-in shell commands.

- A canvas for the art of environment variable manipulation, where settings and values form the palette of your digital masterpiece.

- The crafting of aliases, ephemeral yet powerful, allowing you to name your commands in the tongue of your heart's desire.

- Command execution, an intricate dance of semicolons and logical operators, a choreography of control and precision.

- The graceful handling of exit statuses, where each command's finale is met with the applause of success or the solace of failure.

- The conjuring of files and directories, creation and deletion, like sorcery, bending the digital realm of shell to your will.
